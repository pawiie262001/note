        <h2>Into The Night</h2>
        <p class="subheading">a spotify playlist and message</p>
        <p>Thank you for the last four years. College life has been bearable thanks to you. I appreciate all the help, especially the small talks we've shared on those long nights. I've stood by your side from the very beginning as we journey through the unknowns together. Now, we can see the fruits of our hard work and efforts Congratulations!.<br><br>
        It's funny to think about how uncertain we were back then, but look at us now, ready to step into the next chapter of our lives. We laughed, we cried, and we learned. Despite all the struggles, you never failed to bring happiness and inspiration to me, even if you could be quite annoying at times.<br><br>
        Thank you. It has been an awesome ride with you, and those memories will stay with me forever. I've got you now, and I always will, as long as I breathe. Wishing you all the best wherever life takes you next.<br><br>
        Love lots, Pawiie<br><br>
        ps. Please keep this private hehe
